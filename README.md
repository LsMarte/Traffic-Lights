# Traffic-Lights
Project build in C++
Simple traffic lights use a timer to decide when to switch between 
green, yellow, and red.  You will complete a C++ program that 
implements traffic lights as a class to simulate a car moving through 
multiple intersections on a road. The program allows “normal” lights 
(green, yellow, red) and “abbreviated” lights (only green and red). The 
road always has 4 traffic lights (except in the bonus), though distance 
between lights, starting color of each light, and duration may vary.
